dcpu16tools contains various utlities involving the DCPU-16 architecture for
the upcoming game 0x10c (http://www.0x10c.com).

As of now, the following programs and features have been (or are planned to be)
implemented:

  Emulator/Disassembler:
     * Rudimentary endianness switching (on the top of the "FIXME" list)

     * Slightly sophisiticated disassembling
        - Disassembles instructions only, since origin offsets and data sections
          are usually generated via assembler macros and can not be detected
          in bytecode

     * Auto-Halting, halts the CPU if PC did not change after executing an
       instruction.

     * Some slighty fancy output if verbose mode is enabled

     * PLANNED: Video emulation via ncurses

     * PLANNED: Actual clock cycle emulation

     * PLANNED: Hexdump-like input

  Assembler:
     * "Above average" error messages (and warnings if "--paranoid" is given)

     * Label support as literals, references and offset registers
         (i.e. JSR label, JSR [label], JSR [label + 4])

     * Data sections
         (i.e. :data .dat "Hello, World!", 0)

     * Origin offsets
         i.e.:
           SET [vram + A], 0x42
           ADD A,          1
           SET [vram + A], 0x43

           .org 0x8000
           :vram

     * PLANNED: All the endian goodness.

     * PLANNED: Hexdump-like output format (Somewhat human readable)


All programs are written to be easily modified to accomodate DCPU-16 spec
changes in future and to be easily hackable and understandable, at the expense
of code length (the assembler code is about 1.5 times longer than other DCPU-16
assemblers written in C that I have found).

The programs have been tested on Linux and should work without modification on
most POSIX compatible systems and Windows with some minor changes (getopt_long
related).
